## User Stories
### MVP:
- Entities: Condo Reps, Condo Units, Condo Styles
- CRUD in backend for condo reps, condo units, condo styles 
- Navigation bar at the top of all the pages
- Pages: About, Units Available, Styles, Contact
- **Units Available page** will be filtered to show only units marked as available and have sorting by: **rent**, **square footage**, **bed**, **baths**, **location**, **parking**, **acceptsPets**
- **Unit Styles** page will have list the unit styles and have **sorting** by **space score** (1,2, or 3, with 3 having the most space)
- The **About** page will display location specific features based on selection of **location**
  
### Stretch Goals:
- Add sorting to **Units Available** page by **rep**, and **style**
- Add form to **Contact** page that displays correct contact rep based on either **unit number** or **bedroom count**
- Add full page for each unit available
- custom images for styles
